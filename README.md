Project to make a candlestick phone into a bluetooth call receiver

An android service should hand off calls to the receiver (acting as a bluetooth headset) which will have a speaker and earpiece
built in. Other similar projects just shove a phone into the device, which I don't want to do.

Phase 1)
Send some indicator from the phone to an external device to show that the phone is ringing

Phase 2)
Pick up a call from the phone

Phase 3)
Set up rotary dialer so that calls can be made from the candlestick phone

Phase 4)
Assembly everything into the candlestick phone body

Phase 5) - extra
Make a ringer box attached to candlestick phone ring
